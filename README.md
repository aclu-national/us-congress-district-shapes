# US Congress

An aggregation of data modeling the United States Congress district boundaries,
including a full history of past districts.

## File format

[GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/), in the style of [Who's On First](https://whosonfirst.org/)
records (properties sorted alphabetically, with the geometry last).

## Directory structure

```
data/[state]/[state]_[start session]_to_[end session]_[district].geojson
```

For example, the 1st congressional district for Idaho, from the 66th to 89th
session is saved at this location:

```
data/id/id_66_to_89_01.geojson
```
