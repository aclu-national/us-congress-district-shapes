# US Congress District Shapes

An aggregation of data modeling the United States Congress district boundaries,
including a full history of past districts.

## File format

[GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/), in the style of [Who's On First](https://whosonfirst.org/)
records (pretty-printed, properties sorted alphabetically, with the geometry
last). Note that records lack a Who's On First numeric ID; these records have
not been imported into the Who's On First gazetteer (yet), I am just using
the WOF encoding style.

## File paths

The directory structure and filename are constructed using the following:

* 2-char state (e.g., `ca` for California, or `dc` for District of Columbia,
  from Python's [`us` package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/us))
* When the district started, by congressional session
* When the district ended, by congressional session
* District number (0 refers to at-large, -1 is for "shapes describing Indian
  territories within states during the 18th and early 19th centuries," from
  [Lewis, et al.](https://github.com/JeffreyBLewis/congressional-district-boundaries#documentation))

```
data/[state]/[state]_[start session]_to_[end session]_[district].[display|lookup].geojson
```

For example, the 1st congressional district for Idaho, from the 66th to 89th
session is saved at these locations:

```
data/id/id_66_to_89_1.lookup.geojson
data/id/id_66_to_89_1.display.geojson
```

The two versions correspond to:

* `.lookup.geojson` includes the original geometry
* `.display.geojson` includes a simplified geometry

The simplified geometries are optimized for end-user display, and take up
less space. We use Mapshaper with Douglas-Peucker 20% simplification.

## Building from scratch

You can rebuild the data from the original sources, by using `make data`.

## Spatialite index

You can build a SQLite/Spatialite index with: `make spatialite`.

## PostGIS index

You can build a PostgreSQL/PostGIS index with: `make postgis`.

## Database URL

The database configuration is controlled by the `DATABASE_URL` environment
variable.

```
export DATABASE_URL="sqlite://us-congress.db"
```

For PostGIS:

```
export DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:pass@hostname/dbname"
```

Or a simpler version, for local PostGIS development:

```
export DATABASE_URL="postgres://dbname"
```
